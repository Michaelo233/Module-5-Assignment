## Reflection

### 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing
### your functions.
- I found it had to arrange the functions after writing them.
- I also found it had to test the functions properly, had had to seek 
for an advissor.
- Function makes work easier and less bulky, but need alot of practice.

### 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.

- i faced challenges while mocking my function for testing.
- having a fialed test is very annoying and stressful. needs alot of 
practice to get good at it.
- Each test file should have diffierent names. whether you are testing
for same function.
